I used TypeScript, Deno and Fresh to offer a service where clients could create as many nodes as they pleased without having any technical expertise, just enough crypto, because it was a POS. My service automatically did everything and charged 10% of the earnings of each node.

The project was very well received by the community, praised for its simplicity and practicality. Unfortunately the crypto got rugged by the devs and now the whole project is extinct.

I was obsessed with deploying it as soon as possible when the idea came to me. I remember programming for hours straight, even on weekends. In the end, the project has over 1k commits, all of which are done by me.

#### Redis

[Install Redis on Linux](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-linux/).

Modify `/etc/redis/redis.conf` to suit your needs. By default only localhost can connect to Redis, so no need to
worry about security.
